# MusicGenreClassifier
Implementation of a multilayer perceptron and a convolutional neural network from music genre classification using the GTZAN Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification). The models are deployed with uvicorn, although any service can work by exporting the models. A performance comparison is performed, which is thoroughly explaned in https://www.kaggle.com/code/crismartinezco/different-models-for-music-genre-classification/edit.
